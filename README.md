# <span align="center">Slipstream</span>

**<span align="center">Utility-first CSS for the future</span>**

## Introduction

Slipstream is a standards-driven, utility-first SCSS library pased on [pollen](https://pollen.style) and inspired by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Its a collection of [SCSS variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) that can be used anywhere to encourage consistency, maintainability, and rapid development.

### What it looks like

Slipstream's low-level variables can be used to build any design. They're easy to customise and extend, and they're globally responsive. They don't require preprocessors, class naming conventions, or any new non-standard syntax.

```css
.button {
  font-size: $scale-00;
  font-weight: $font-medium;
  padding: $size-2 $size-3;
  background: $color-blue;
  border-radius: $radius-sm;
  box-shadow: $elevation-2;
  color: white;
}
```
